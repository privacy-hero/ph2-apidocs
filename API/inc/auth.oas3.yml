        This response contains the clients credentials to use on subsequent API
        calls relating to the client.  These credentials uniquely identify the
        client and their account.

          - **bearer**: The Client Authorization Bearer token required to be
          sent in the **Authorization: Bearer** header of all API calls that are
          called on behalf of the Client.
          - **renew**: The Epoch Time, at which user access will expire with
          this token. Renew before this time, for uninterrupted access.  Renewal
          may occur up until **exp** time.
          - **exp**: The Epoch Time, at which the token will completely expire
          and may not be used for renewal.  After this time the user must
          re-authenticate to get a new bearer token.
      required:
        - bearer
