    Profile:
      description: |-
        A device settings profile.  Profiles define common settings for all
        associated devices.

        - **id**: The profiles unique id.
        - **adapter**: The unique id of the adapter the profile belongs to.
        - **name**: The descriptive name of the profile.
        - **icon**: An identifier for the icon.
        - **system**: Is this a system profile?  If so, can not be edited or
        deleted.
        - **settings**: Current state of settings for the profile.

    Bedtime:
      description: |-
        A time setting which defines when a "bedtime" state on a profile occurs.
        In the UI, bedtime is defined as a Start and End time, however we define
        a bedtime in the system as a Start time, and a duration.  There can only
        be ONE bedtime per day, but the duration may make the bedtime extend
        the next day.  Nominally a disabled bedtime should be encoded as
        start-time=0 and duration=0
        - **start-time**: The absolute time that bedtime starts.
        - **duration**: The delay from **start-time** until bedtime ends.

        This is a list of bedtimes for the week.  The first element is always
        MONDAY. The second is TUESDAY, and so on, until SUNDAY (the seventh
        item).  This will need to be displayed correctly depending on how the
        client defines which day is the start of the week. MONDAY is not
        defined as the start of the week, it is an arbitrary starting point for
        this array only.

        - **internet-pause**: Internet will be paused until this time passes. If
          the value is negative, internet is paused indefinitely.
        - **bedtime**: A list of bedtimes, one for each day of a week.
        - **bedtime-delay**: A once off delay for the current days bedtime
        start.  Note, this does not change bedtime end.  This will automatically
        be reset back to zero when bedtime ends.
