  version: "0.0.1"
  description: |-
    This API is only used by browser extensions.

    Browser extensions perform operations through the router/adapter directly
    this api allows those functions and browser extensions to operate and behave
    reliably.

    If the devices browser is not behind the adapter/router a server will reply
    to these messages and the browser extension can detect this state from the
    reply.

    Note, when the adapter is handling the api, the connection will be over
    http.  However when connected to the backend server the connection will
    be https.

        # Usage
        All Browser extension API calls are performed with a post.  The json
        body of the post determines the operation which will be performed. A
        json body will be returned in the 200 reply with the result of the
        command.

        All operations are synchronous.
