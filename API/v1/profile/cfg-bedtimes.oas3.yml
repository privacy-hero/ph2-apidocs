      summary: Set the weekly bedtimes for a profile.
      description: |-
        # Usage

        Allows the Start time for "Bedtime" to be set independently for "School
        Nights" and "Other Nights".  The duration of a "Bedtime" is system
        controlled.  School Nights are the nights BEFORE a school day.  So, in
        the typical school system where a school day is Monday to Friday, school
        nights are Sunday thru Thursday.

        ## Parameters
          - **id**: The unique id of the profile.
          - **school**: The time in minutes from midnight when bedtime
          starts on a "school night".  Set to -1 if it is disabled.
          - **other**: The time in minutes from midnight when bedtime
          starts on nights other than school nights.  Set to -1 if it is
          disabled.
          - **school-nights**: An array of booleans which sets which nights of the
          week are school nights.  The First entry is Monday, the last is
          Sunday.  true = This is a school night.  false = It is not a school night.
