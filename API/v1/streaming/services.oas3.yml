            The filter to apply to the service list, the list can contain ALL
            services, or only Portable or Non-Portable services.
            If the parameter is missing, or is **null** the call will return ALL
            services.

            A **Portable** Service is one where the one subscription may be used
            in multiple countries.

            A **Non-Portable** Service is region locked to the subscription.
            For example, a US Non-Portable Service can only view US content, and
            can not be relocated to view UK content.
