        # Usage

        Generates a list of streaming services currently supported by the
        system. The List is used to choose the streaming services to be set by
        the **/v1/streaming/cfg** api call.

        The call may return all services, or only Portable or Non-Portable
        services, as required.

        ## Security Requirements
          - **appKey** **MUST NOT** be present in the call.
          - **clientToken** **MUST** be present, not in need of renewal and
          valid.

        ## Parameters
          - **type**: The types of services to return, options are All,
         Portable and non-portable.

        A **Portable** Service is one where the one subscription may be used
        in multiple countries.  A client may use relocation to view any
        available stream where a proxy exists, or the stream from their current
        location, even if no proxy exists for it.

        A **Non-Portable** Service is region locked to the subscription.
        For example, a US Non-Portable Service can only view US content, and
        can not be relocated to view UK content.  For example, Relocation on these accounts
        allows a client with a US account, to view that content while in the UK.
        It will not allow a client with a US account to view content on the UK
        version of the service.
