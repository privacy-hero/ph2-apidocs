        # Usage
        Returns a list of all current subscriptions, their state and the
        adapter they are associated with, if any.  The ID of any adapter
        that does not have a subscription is also returned.

      responses:

            The response to this message is the list of all current
            subscriptions of the account, and their associated adapter, as well
            as a list of the id of all adapters without a current subscription.

            The subscription list contains ALL subscriptions for the client, and
            their status.  IF the subscription is associated with an adapter,
            the adapter_id will be set to the adapters unique id.  Otherwise the
            adapter_id will be null or not present.

            unassigned_adapters is a list of all adapter id's which do not
            currently have a subscription associated with them.
