        # Usage
        Allows the client to subscribe/unsubscribe web push notifications.

        Push notifications require the client to authorize the subscription.
        The App is responsible for getting the clients authority with the
        relevant service, and then passing the WebPush Client Token (AKA
        "Registration Id") to the Backend API.  Anytime the WebPush Client Token
        is renewed by the Client, this same call is made to update it.

        ## Parameters
          - **token**: the WebPush Client Token obtained when the client
          consented to receiving notifications.
          - **service**: the WebPush Service being employed by the clients
          application.
            - **"FIREBASE"** is used for Android and non-safari web push
            notifications.
            - **"APNS-IOS"** is used for IOS Apps.
            - **"APNS-WEB"** is used for Safari Web Push notifications.
          - **cancel**: Optional.  Set to True, to cancel notifications for the service.
