      summary: Change the Adapter Service Configuration.
      description: |-
        # Usage
        For a particular Adapter, change its current service configuration.
        When called, if the state requested differs from the state currently
        active in the router, the backend will create a timestamp for the
        request and send it to the router.  It will return that timestamp to the
        caller.  The caller must then poll **v1/adapter/cfg** at regular
        intervals until either a reasonable time has passed, or the state
        changes and/or the state timestamp equals or exceeds the returned
        request timestamp.  When the router applies the state change
        successfully, the backend will be informed and supplied the timestamp of
        the request, so that the backend can update the configuration to
        persistently store the new state of the router.

        ## Parameters
          - **id**: The adapters ID.  Can only change config for adapters
          associated with the calling clients account.
          - **service**: The name of the service to set.
          - **state**: The state to set the service to.
