      summary: Claim the specified adapter for the clients account.
      description: |-
        # Usage

        Claims the specified adapter and associates it with the clients account.
        The Claim can only succeed if the Adapter is not associated with an
        account.

        This API Call may also be used to replace an existing adapter, by
        specifying the existing adapters AdapterID.  In which case, the existing
        adapter will be unassociated from the clients account and the newly
        claimed adapter will replace it in its entirety.

        ## Parameters
          - **id**: The id of the adapter the client wants to claim.
          - **oldid**: Optional. Allows the claimed adapter t replace an
          existing adapter on the clients account.  In this instance, the old
          adapter becomes unassociated with any account, and the new adapter
          takes over the configuration, discovered devices and profiles of the
          old adapter.
