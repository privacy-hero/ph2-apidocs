        # Usage
        Generates a list of adapters associated with the clients account.
        Can list a single adapter, or all adapters associated with the account.
        In the case that a client has no adapters associated, this will be an
        empty list.

        ## Security Requirements
          - **appKey** **MUST NOT** be present in the call.
          - **clientToken** **MUST** be present, not in need of renewal and valid.

        ## Parameters
          - **id**: Optional, the ID of the adapter, if only one adapters
          information is being requested.  Only adapters associated with a
          clients account can be returned with this call.  IF the id is valid,
          but the adapter is not associated with this clients account, then that
          is treated the same as the adapter ID being invalid.
