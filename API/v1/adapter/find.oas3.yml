      summary: Find Unassociated adapters we can bind the client account to.
      description: |-
        # Usage
        When an adapter is first installed, it is not linked to an account.
        The client must add the adapter to their account, this function will
        return a list of adapters which are available to be associated.

        It will either find all adapters on the same local network as the client
        connection.  Or if that does not work, an adapter with a specific
        activation code.

        ## Security Requirements
          - **appKey** **MUST NOT** be present in the call.
          - **clientToken** **MUST** be present, not in need of renewal and valid.

        ## Parameters
          - **code**: This is the optional activation code.  If not set, the
            function will look for all unassociated adapters that share the
            internet connection of the client making the call.

            However, IF that fails, this can be set to a known activation code
            which will cause any adapter with the matching activation code which
            is not currently associated with an account to be returned.
            Typically this would be a single Adapter.  If no adapters are found,
            a "404" response will be generated.

                - **mac**: Adapters hardware mac address
                - **type**: The type of adapter hardware.
                - **desc**: Long form description of the adapter hardware.
