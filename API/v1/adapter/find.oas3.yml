      summary: Find Unassociated adapters we can bind the client account to.
      description: |-
        When an adapter is first installed, it is not linked to an account.
        The client must add the adapter to their account, this function will
        return a list of adapters which are available to be associated.

        It will either find all adapters on the same local network as the client
        connection.  Or if that does not work, a list of all adapters which are
        currently unassociated and have the same two last digits of the MAC
        address as optionally provided in this call.

            If not set, the function will look for all unassociated adapters
            that share the internet connection of the client making the call.

            However, IF that fails, this can be set to the last two digits of
            the MAC address, which will return a global list of all connected
            adapters which are not currently associated with an account, and
            share the two last characters specified.
