      description: |-
        When an adapter is first installed, it is not linked to an account.
        The client must add the adapter to their account, this function will
        return a list of adapters which are available to be associated.

        It will either find all adapters on the same local network as the client
        connection.  Or if that does not work, an adapter with a specific
        activation code.

            If not set, the function will look for all unassociated adapters
            that share the internet connection of the client making the call.

            However, IF that fails, this can be set to a known activation code
            which will cause any adapter with the activation code which is not
            currently associated with an account to be returned.  Typically
            this would be a single Adapter.  If no adapters are found, a "200"
            response will be generated, but the list of adapters will be empty.
