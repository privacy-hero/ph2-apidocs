        # Usage
        Sets the Wifi settings for the 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz Network for an adapter.
        If an adapter has multiple wifi radios, both radios will be set to the
        same SSID, and password.  If the adapter has no radios, this command
        yields no results on the adapter.

        ## Parameters
          - **id**: The id of the adapter to configure.
          - **wifi**: The wifi settings for the adapter. Any setting excluded or
           set to **null** will not be changed.
