        # Usage

        Causes the Clients Email Address to be changed.
        Will also cause an email to be sent to both the
        old email address, advising the client it is being changed.
        AND, to the new email address to confirm the address is valid.

        The Confirmation Email contains the callback as an embedded link which
        will call back into the initiating application.

        The URL passed as the callback must be able to accept three parameter in
        the url of the form:
        ```
        callback.url/path?verify=<token>&pw=<false/true>&exp=<time>
        ```
         - **verify** is the verification token to be sent back to the API server by
            the app on the **/v1/auth/confirmcustomer** call.
         - **pwd** specifies that a confirmation password must be prompted from
            the Client, and supplied to the API in the **/v1/auth/confirmcustomer**
            call.
         - **exp** specifies when the verification token will expire.  Any call
            to **/v1/auth/confirmcustomer**` after this time will fail.

        ## Parameters
          - **email**: The new email address to change to.
          - **callback**: The complete URL, minus parameters, which is embedded in
          the email sent to the customer to confirm their account creation. It
          must point to the app which instigated this request.
