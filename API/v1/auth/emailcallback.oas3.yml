        # Usage
        This is the format of the callback that will be presented to the
        customer in their confirmation email.

        It is linked to the instigating App, so that the App can continue
        the process of creating the new account, resetting the password,
        re-establishing credentials, etc .

        ## Security Requirements

        There are no specific security requirements.  However the token is
        cryptographically signed, and only valid for the specified duration.
        The application only needs to check the duration in the call, the API
        server will verify the token remains valid and is properly formed when
        the token is presented.

        ## Parameters
         - **verify** is the verification token to be sent back to the API server by
            the app on the **/v1/auth/confirmcustomer** call.
         - **pwd** specifies that a confirmation password must be prompted from
            the Client, and supplied to the API in the **/v1/auth/confirmcustomer**
            call.
         - **exp** specifies when the verification token will expire.  Any call
            to **/v1/auth/confirmcustomer**` after this time will fail.
