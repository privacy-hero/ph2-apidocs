      summary: Renew a Client Authorization Token.
      description: |-
        # Usage

        When the Clients Authorization Token is about to (or already has)
        reached its expiry time.  This call is made to provide a new token for
        continued use of the API without requiring account recover.  If the
        token has finally passed its "refreshh by" time, account recovery will
        be required to generate a new fresh Token.

        Causes the Authorization token attached to the API call
        to be renewed, and a new token returned.
      parameters:
        - in: query
          required: false

            The applications API Key.  Must be the same application the client
            authorized on or logged in with.  This prevents anyone in possession
            of the clients JWT Token, from renewing it without also having
            access to a matching Application API Key.
