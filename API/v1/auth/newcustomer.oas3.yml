      summary: Request New Customer/Forgotten Password

        # Usage

        If the email address supplied in the message is not registered in the
        system, then this message is processed as a "New Customer
        Registration". Overwise this messages is processed
        as an "Existing Customer forgot password" request.

        The ONLY difference in the processing is the form of the email which is
        sent to the customer.  Either acknowledging their request for a new
        account, OR acknowledging their request to change their password.

        Upon receipt of this message, an email will be sent to the supplied
        email address.  It will contain instructions to click a provided link in
        the message which will act as a callback to the initiating application.

        The URL passed as the callback must be able to accept three parameter in
        the url of the form:
        ```
        callback.url/<path>?verify=<token>&pw=<false/true>&exp=<time>
        ```

         - **verify** is the verification token to be sent back to the API server by
        the app on the **/v1/auth/confirmcustomer** call.
         - **pw** specifies that an initial password must be prompted from the Client,
        and supplied to the API in the **/v1/auth/confirmcustomer** call.
         - **exp** specifies when the verification token will expire.  Any call to
        **/v1/auth/confirmcustomer**` after this time will fail.

        ## Security Requirements
          - **appKey** must be valid and present in the call.
          - **clientToken** may be present, but is ignored.

        ## Parameters
          - **email**: The email address the customer wants the Account email to be
        directed to.
          - **callback**: The complete URL, minus parameters, which is embedded in the email sent
        to the customer to confirm their account creation. It must point to the
        app which instigated this request.
