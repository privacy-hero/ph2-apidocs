      summary: Request New Customer/Forgotten Password
      description: |-
        If the email address supplied in the message is not registered in the
        system.  Then this message is processed as a "New Customer
        Registration".  IF the email does exist, then this messages is processed
        as a "Existing Customer forgot password".

        The ONLY difference in the processing is the form of the email which is
        sent to the customer.  Either acknowledging their request for a new
        account, OR acknowledging their request to change their password.

        Upon receipt of this message, an email will be sent to the supplied
        email address.  It will contain instructions to click a provided link in
        the message which will act as a callback to the initiating application.

        The URL passed as the callback must be able to accept three parameter in
        the url of the form:
          - verify=\<verification token\>
          - pw=false/true
          - exp=\<time>\

        `verify` is the verification token to be sent back to the API server by
        the app on the `confirmcustomer` call.

        `pw` specifies is an initial password must be prompted from the Client,
        and supplied to the API in the `confirmcustomer` call.

        `exp` specifies when the verification token will expire.  Any call to
        `confirmcustomer` after this time will fail.

        Must have a valid appToken for the request to be processed.
