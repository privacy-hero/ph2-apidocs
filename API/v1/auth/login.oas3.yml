      summary: Log a Client in to their account.
      description: |-
        # Usage
        Logs a client in to their account, by validating their credentials
        and returning a Bearer token for API access.

        Must have a valid appKey for the request to be processed.

        This API call is only made for applications that use a password for
        authorization validation.  Other applications need to do account
        recovery if the access token is lost or expired.

        ## Security Requirements
          The Authorization Bearer token sent to authenticate for this message
          is the Application unique and pre-distributed App Token.

        ## Parameters
          - **id**: The clients ID,  different clients will present different ID.
            - Customer: Their email address
            - Admin: Their email address
            - Admin as Customer: \<admin email\>:\<customer email\>
            - Router: MAC Address
          - **pwd**: The shared secret used to identify the client.  Typically this
        is a password.  It is sent unencrypted/unhashed because the link is
        protected from eaves dropping with https.
