    wifi:
        ssid: string  .. We will need multiple ssid, because we have 2.4G and
                         maybe in the future could have multiple 5ghz like
                         routers do now.
        key: string    .. could use the same key for different bands. But that
                          should be a UI decision.

    firmware: "number string"  ??  I guess a firmware ID/checksum

    dns_forwarding:
        default: {

        only works in that country.

    Command to (for a non-portable service) set the country it uses.
    Command to (for a portable service) set the country it uses (including home
        country if there are no proxys)

    selected country. (defaults to adapters country)
